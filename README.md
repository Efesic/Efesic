I'm an undergraduate **physics** student at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB), currently studying my third year. I'm also a foundational member of  _Optica't_, a divulgational group of physical optics. In this GitHub account you'll find academic projects, personal projects and _Optica't_ projects. There are some examples of:

- üéì An academc project:
[Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics exercises](https://github.com/Efesic/TiME)

- ‚òÄÔ∏è A personal project (WIP):
[Modelling and simulation of a Solar Panel](https://github.com/GallardoDodd/FvOptim)

- üíé An _Optica't_ project (WIP):
[Introductory LaTeX course](https://github.com/Efesic/Curs-LateX)

Currently my projects are written in catalan or spanish, but I'm working for tranlate the most relevant ones ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

### Technologies:

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![Fortran](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fortran-%23734F96.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=fortran&logoColor=white)
![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/latex-%23008080.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=latex&logoColor=white)

- Python: used sometimes to compute some mathematical expresions and do simple data analysis, mostly used to make plots with the library matplotlib.
- LaTeX: to generate files like reports, courses or any other formal document.
- Fortran: used to do more complex simulations or compute iterations more efficiently.
